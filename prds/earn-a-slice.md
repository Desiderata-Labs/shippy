# 1. Product Summary

**Potential Names:**

- Build Guild
- Earn A Slice

**Domains**

- buildguild.ai
- earnaslice.com
- helpbuildthis.com
- helpme.build

**Taglines**

- Ship work. Earn royalties.
- Build together, share the upside.

**One-liner**

> Earn A Slice lets founders “open-source” parts of their startup: they post real work (growth, marketing, product, etc.), contributors help ship it, and everyone who contributes earns an ongoing **share of the upside**, not just a one-off payment.

**What it is**

- A platform where:
  - **Founders** create **Projects** (their products/companies).
  - They define a **Reward Pool** (e.g. 10% of Oath Notes profits).
  - They publish **Bounties** (specific tasks with point rewards: growth, sales, content, design).
  - **Contributors** claim bounties, deliver results, and earn **Points** tied to **measured performance**.
  - Points convert into **recurring payouts** out of that pool.

**What it’s not (on purpose)**

- Not a generic freelance marketplace.
- Not a “find a cofounder” app.
- Not a token/crypto play.
- Not complex cap table equity; this is **off-cap-table, rev/profit-share**.

**Initial target users**

# 2. Problem & Opportunity

### Founder Problem

- Solo or tiny founding teams can build impressive infra/product…
- …but get stuck on **distribution, growth, marketing, and sales**.
- Hiring full-time is expensive and risky.
- Traditional agencies/freelancers are misaligned:
  - Paid hourly or per deliverable.
  - Incentive to bill, not to generate **durable revenue**.

- Equity feels too permanent and binary:
  - Either “no equity” or “here’s 10–20% in perpetuity.”

**Result:** It’s easier to ship product than to build a repeatable growth engine.

### Contributor Problem

- Skilled people (growth, content, sales, design, dev) want:
  - **Leverage**: upside in things they help grow.
  - A way to build a **portfolio** of product contributions.
  - A model between “full-time job” and “cold freelance gig.”

- They lack:
  - A structured way to **earn ongoing upside** in multiple products.
  - Clear rules for **how contributions turn into $$** (vs vague “we’ll figure out equity later”).

### Opportunity

- Create an **Assembly-style** platform for 2025+:
  - Real products.
  - Clear contribution rules.
  - Programmatic rev/profit sharing tied to **performance**, not vibes.

- Think: **GitHub for startups**, where contributors earn royalties instead of GitHub stars.

# 3. Target Users & Personas

### 1. Founders

**Who:**
Solo founders or small teams with a built or shipping product who:

- Are strong in product/engineering.
- Are weak or time-constrained in **growth / GTM**.
- Are willing to share a bounded % of upside to accelerate.

**Core Needs:**

- A way to **turn "I need help" into structured Bounties**.
- Protection from "pump-and-dump" contributors.
- Control over **what % of upside is shared** and **under what rules**.
- Trustable, easy-to-explain model they can show advisors/investors.

---

### 2. Contributors

**Who:**

- Growth marketers, salespeople, content creators, designers, devs.
- Indie hackers who are good at shipping specific outcomes (e.g., SEO, email, outbound, UX).

**Core Needs:**

- Ability to **earn upside without quitting their day job**.
- Clarity: “If I do X and it works, I get Y (and Y keeps paying if it keeps working).”
- Visibility: a way to show and track their contributions and earnings over time.
- Protection from flaky founders who promise upside and vanish.

---

### 3. (Later) Ecosystem / Platform

- “Power users” who:
  - Contribute to many projects.
  - Build reputation as **growth mercenaries**.

- Potential **investors** monitoring traction/metrics.
- Potential **labs/companies** that want to plug in specialized contributors.

MVP: focus primarily on **Founders + Contributors**; platform/network effects come later.

---

# 4. Core Product Concept & Mental Models

Think about it as three combined metaphors:

1. **GitHub repo** – A project you can "open up" to others.
2. **Bounty board** – Specific, well-defined outcomes that are up for grabs.
3. **Royalty / rev-share engine** – People who contribute to results share in ongoing upside.

### GitHub Mental Model

Most contributors already understand GitHub. We use familiar patterns:

| GitHub       | Earn A Slice     | Notes                                         |
| ------------ | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Repository   | **Project**      | The product/company being built               |
| README.md    | **Readme**       | About, mission, links (Discord, assets, docs) |
| Issues       | **Bounties**     | Specific tasks with point rewards             |
| Contributors | **Contributors** | Auto-computed from accepted submissions       |
| Pull Request | **Submission**   | Contributor's work + proof                    |
| Merge        | **Approval**     | Founder approves → points awarded             |
| Sponsors     | **Reward Pool**  | The $ that flows to contributors              |

**Key Concepts (for users, not engineers):**

- **Project** – The thing you're building (e.g. "Oath Notes").
- **Readme** – Markdown-style about page: mission, how to help, links to Discord/resources.
- **Bounties** – Concrete ways to help with clear rules and point rewards (e.g. "Bring in a new clinic that stays 90+ days: 100 points").
- **Contributors** – Anyone who has earned points via approved submissions (auto-computed, like GitHub's contributor list).
- **Reward Pool** – The slice of revenue/profit reserved for contributors (e.g. "10% of net profit").
- **Points** – Your share of the Reward Pool. The more points you collect, the bigger your cut.
- **Payouts** – Regular distributions of the Reward Pool to all contributors, in proportion to their points.

# 5. Value Proposition (per user type)

### For Founders (like you with Oath)

- **Turn your product into a magnet for talent**
  Attract people who are good at growth, content, sales, etc. by giving them upside, not random promises.

- **De-risk growth experiments**
  You only pay when things work (e.g., a new clinic stays 90 days, or MRR actually increases).

- **Keep control & cap exposure**
  You choose:
  - What % of revenue/profit is shared.
  - What counts as a qualifying contribution.
  - When and how payouts are done.

- **Narrative benefit**
  “We run Oath like an open-source company. Anyone who helps us grow shares in the upside.”

---

### For Contributors

- **Get paid for outcomes, not time**
  If you’re good at bringing revenue or users, your work can compound, not just pay once.

- **Stack small bets**
  Work with several projects; some pay a little, some might break out and pay for years.

- **Portfolio & reputation**
  Show:
  - “I helped Oath grow MRR by $X.”
  - “I have Y points and Z total lifetime earnings across projects.”

---

# 6. Primary Use Cases (MVP)

1. **Founder wants growth help without hiring FTE**
   - Sets up a Reward Pool and a few initial Bounties (new customers, case studies, etc.).
   - Shares project on Discover page.
   - Runs a few quarters of payouts.

2. **Contributor wants upside in a promising startup**
   - Browses Discover page, finds a project like Oath.
   - Claims Bounties aligned with their skills.
   - Delivers results, earns points, and starts seeing quarterly payouts.

3. **Ongoing collaboration**
   - Founder sees who's actually generating results (Contributors tab).
   - Doubles down: adds more Bounties with better point rewards.
   - That contributor becomes a quasi-"growth co-founder," but on a **structured, rev-share basis**.

---

# 7. User Journeys (High-Level UX)

## 7.1 Founder Journey – “Rob with Oath Notes”

**Goal:** Get clinics for Oath Notes via contributors and align them with upside.

1. **Sign up & create Project**
   - Land on marketing page → “Open-source your startup’s growth.”
   - Onboard flow asks:
     - What is your product?
     - What % of revenue/profit are you willing to share (e.g. 10%)?
     - How often do you want to pay out (monthly/quarterly)?

   - Result: Project page: “Oath Notes – Growth Pool”.

2. **Define Reward Pool**
   - Simple UI copy:
     - “You’re allocating **10% of Oath Notes net profit** to contributors.”
     - Clarify: “If profit is 0, no payout; nothing is owed.”

   - You can edit this later, but changes only affect future periods.

3. **Create initial Bounties**
   - Templates for typical bounties:
     - "Bring in a new paying customer"
     - "Publish a case study that converts"
     - "Reach MRR milestone"

   - You configure:
     - New clinic active > 90 days → 100 points.
     - Case study that leads to a clinic within 120 days → 50 points.
     - Hitting $10k net-new MRR in a quarter → 500 bonus points.

   - Each Bounty has:
     - Title + description
     - Point reward
     - Tags (growth, sales, content, design)
     - What success looks like
     - Evidence required (e.g. demo notes, contract, Stripe screenshot).

4. **Invite contributors**
   - Share an invite link with:
     - Growth folks in your network.
     - Indie hacker communities.
     - Possibly a “friends of Oath” circle.

   - Invite page explains:
     - What Oath does.
     - How the Reward Pool works.
     - Examples: “If Oath makes $40k profit this quarter, pool is $4k. If you hold 25% of points, you get $1k.”

5. **Review contributions**
   - Contributors submit:
     - “I closed Clinic ABC; here’s proof.”
     - “Here’s a case study we shipped that drove this clinic.”

   - You decide:
     - Approve or reject.
     - Adjust points if needed.

6. **Run a payout**
   - At quarter end, you:
     - Enter: net profit or revenue for Oath Notes.
     - Platform shows how the 10% pool is split by points.

   - You approve and pay via your existing payment channels (MVP: manual).

7. **Iterate**
   - Add more Bounties as you see what works:
     - "Launch webinar series."
     - "Land a partnership that drives 3+ clinics."

   - Adjust point values and rules as you learn.

---

## 7.2 Contributor Journey – “Growth Partner”

**Goal:** Earn ongoing revenue share for driving clinics to Oath Notes.

1. **Discovers Oath's Project**
   - Finds Oath on the Discover page, or receives a direct link.
   - Project page shows:
     - Readme: What Oath Notes is, mission, how to help.
     - Reward Pool: "10% of net profit, paid monthly."
     - Open Bounties with point rewards.

2. **Onboards to Project**
   - Accepts invite, agrees to Contributor Terms:
     - IP ownership.
     - Payout rules (no profit → no pool).
     - Anti-fraud policies (no fake leads).

3. **Claims Bounties**
   - Views Bounties tab:
     - "New clinic active 90 days → 100 points"
     - "Case study that leads to a clinic → 50 points"

   - Claims what fits their skills:
     - Outbound clinics in their network.
     - Works on a clinic-friendly case study.

4. **Submits contributions**
   - After closing Clinic ABC:
     - Logs a contribution with proof.

   - After case study launches and converts:
     - Logs that as well.

5. **Sees point balance & potential earnings**
   - Dashboard:
     - “You have 300 points in Oath Notes (10% Reward Pool).”
     - “Last quarter’s pool: $4,000; your share: $900.”

6. **Builds portfolio**
   - Over time, they can:
     - Contribute to multiple projects.
     - See total lifetime earnings and points.
     - Show this to future clients/founders as proof of effectiveness.

# 8. MVP Product Surfaces

Laser-focused on the **bounty ↔ reward loop**. Three core surfaces per project, plus a simple Discover page.

---

### 8.1 Project Page

Each project has one page with three tabs:

#### Tab 1: Readme (default view)

Like a GitHub README. Founder writes this in markdown-ish format.

- **Mission / About**: What the product is, why it exists
- **How to Help**: What kinds of contributions are valuable
- **Links**: Discord, docs, brand assets, website
- **Reward Pool Summary**: "10% of net profit → distributed monthly"

#### Tab 2: Bounties

Like GitHub Issues. The core of the reward loop.

- **List of open bounties**, each showing:
  - Title: "Close a new clinic (90-day retention)"
  - Points: "+100 points"
  - Tags: `growth`, `sales`, `content`, `design`
  - Status: Open / Claimed / Completed
  - Description: what's required, how success is verified

- **Filters**: by tag, by status
- **Sort**: by points (highest first), by date

- **Claim flow**: Contributor clicks "I'm working on this"
- **Submit flow**: Contributor submits proof → Founder approves/rejects → Points awarded

#### Tab 3: Contributors

Auto-computed from approved submissions. Like GitHub's contributor graph.

- **List of everyone who holds points**, showing:
  - Avatar + username
  - Points held
  - % of total pool
  - Lifetime earnings from this project

- Sorted by points (descending)
- **This IS the team**—no separate setup required

#### Submission Flow (Detail)

Submissions work like GitHub Pull Requests—a private thread between contributor and founder.

**Privacy:**

- Submissions are **private by default**—only the contributor and founder can see them
- Other contributors cannot see each other's submissions or evidence
- This protects sensitive information (sales contacts, strategy details, proprietary work)

**Submission contents:**

- **Text description**: What was done, context, notes
- **Attachments**: Screenshots, documents, files (stored in R2)
- **Links**: External evidence (Stripe dashboard, CRM records, published content)

**Conversation thread:**

Like a PR, there can be back-and-forth before approval:

---

### 8.3 Contributor Dashboard

Personal view for logged-in contributors.

- **My Projects**: list of projects I've contributed to

---

### 8.5 Payout History & Verification

Builds trust before programmatic payments exist. Shows that real money is flowing.

#### Payout Timeline (on Project Page)

A chronological feed of payout events, visible to all contributors:

- **Payout announced**: "Q4 2024 payout: $4,000 pool (10% of $40k profit)"
- **Split calculated**: shows each contributor's share
- **Payout marked complete**: founder marks as sent
- **Contributors confirm receipt**: each contributor can click "✓ Received"

Example timeline entry:

```
📅 December 2024 Payout
   Pool: $4,000 (10% of $40k net profit)

   @jane — 250 pts (25%) — $1,000 — ✓ Confirmed received
   @mike — 150 pts (15%) — $600  — ✓ Confirmed received
   @sara — 100 pts (10%) — $400  — ⏳ Pending confirmation
```

#### Visibility Rules

| Viewer                        | What they see                                               |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Public** (logged out)       | Total paid out, # of payouts, # contributors                |
| **Contributors** (on project) | Full payout history, their own amounts, confirmation status |
| **Founder**                   | Everything + ability to mark payouts sent                   |

#### Payout Flow & Timing

Here's how the full cycle works:

```
1. WORK PHASE
   └─ Contributor claims bounty, does work, submits proof
   └─ Founder approves → Points awarded immediately
   └─ Points accumulate through the payout period

2. PAYOUT PERIOD ENDS (monthly/quarterly, set by founder)
   └─ Founder enters profit/revenue for the period
   └─ System calculates: Pool = Profit × Pool %
   └─ System shows split: each contributor's $ amount

3. FOUNDER MARKS "SENT"
   └─ Founder pays contributors externally (PayPal, Wise, bank, etc.)
   └─ Founder clicks "Mark as Sent" for each contributor (or bulk)
   └─ Optional: add payment reference ("PayPal txn #12345")

4. CONTRIBUTOR CONFIRMS RECEIPT
   └─ Contributor gets notified: "Payout sent—please confirm"
   └─ Contributor clicks "✓ Received" (or "⚠️ Not received")
   └─ Optional: add note ("Received via Wise, thanks!")

5. VERIFICATION WINDOW (30 days)
   └─ If confirmed → payout marked as "Verified ✓"
   └─ If disputed → founder notified, flagged for resolution
   └─ If no response after 30 days → marked "Unconfirmed ⏳"
```

#### What "Unconfirmed after 30 days" Means

- **Not a penalty**, just visibility—contributor may have forgotten
- Shows on payout history: "⏳ Awaiting confirmation (35 days)"
- Affects project's trust score on Discover page
- Founder can nudge contributor to confirm
- If pattern of unconfirmed payouts → red flag for new contributors

#### Dispute Flow (simple for MVP)

If contributor clicks "⚠️ Not received":

- Founder gets notified immediately
- Payout marked as "Disputed"
- Visible in payout history (transparency)
- Resolution happens off-platform (for now)
- Either party can mark resolved

#### Trust Signals

- **"X of Y contributors confirmed receipt"** shown on each payout
- **"This project has Z verified payouts totaling $X"** on Discover page
- **Unconfirmed payouts** visible but not damning (life happens)
- **Disputed payouts** are a red flag—shown prominently
- Contributors can leave optional note: "Received via PayPal" / "Received via Wise"

This creates a public record that payouts actually happen—critical for attracting new contributors.

## 8.6 The Core Loop

This is what we're optimizing for:

```

## 8.7 Surfacing to Incentivize

The loop only works if people can SEE that it works.

**On Project Page (public):**

- 💰 **Total paid out**: "$12,400 earned by contributors"
- 👥 **Active contributors**: "8 people earning from this project"
- 📈 **Latest payout**: "Last month: $2,100 distributed"
- 🎯 **Open bounties**: "5 bounties worth 450 points available"

**On Discover Page:**

- Default sort: "most paid out" (shows projects that actually pay)
- Show real $ numbers prominently, not vanity metrics
- Show verified payout count: "12 payouts confirmed by contributors"
- Filter by "has open bounties" to find work right now
- Filter by "has verified payouts" to find proven projects

**On Contributor profiles (later):**

- "Jane has earned $3,200 across 4 projects"
- Portable proof of effectiveness

**Social proof copy:**

- "This project has paid $X to Y contributors"
- "Top contributor earned $Z last quarter"

---

## 9. Pool Expansion, Dilution & Fairness

This section explains how contributor “dilution” works, why it’s acceptable (and often positive), and how founders should structure goals/milestones to keep everyone focused on real revenue and outcomes.

### 9.1 Mental Model

- Each Project has a **Reward Pool** (e.g. “10% of net profit from Oath Notes”).

- Contributors earn **Points** for delivering verified outcomes.

- Each payout period, the Reward Pool is split **pro-rata by points**:

  > `User Share = Pool Amount × (User Points / Total Points)`

- When new points are granted to new contributors, **existing contributors’ percentage share decreases** (dilution) but **their absolute payout can still increase** if the pie (revenue/profit) grows enough.

**Key principle:**

> **Dilution is acceptable when expanding the contributor pool creates more total value than it subtracts in percentage ownership.**
> If new contributors grow revenue/profit, existing contributors should earn _more money_, even if their share of the pool shrinks.

### 9.2 What “Expanding the Pool” Means

In Earn A Slice v1:

- The **Reward Pool %** (e.g. 10% of profit) is set by the founder and only changed explicitly.
- “Expanding the pool” normally means:
  - Adding **new contributors** and
  - Granting **new points** when they produce verified, revenue-linked outcomes.

This **does not** retroactively change past payouts; it only affects **future periods**.

### 9.3 When Dilution Is Fair vs. Unfair

**Fair dilution (intended case):**

- New contributors:
  - Bring in more clinics, customers, revenue, or durable growth.
  - Hit well-defined, pre-agreed milestones.

- Result:
  - Total profit/revenue increases.
  - Reward Pool in dollar terms grows.
  - Existing contributors’ percentage share shrinks, but their **payouts stay flat or rise**.

**Unfair dilution (what the system should avoid):**

- Points are granted:
  - For vague or unmeasured work.
  - For contributions that don’t drive durable value.
  - Without clear rules communicated up front.

- Result:
  - New people dilute the pool **without** growing the pie.

**Product stance:**
Earn A Slice's UX and defaults should **strongly encourage / nudge** founders toward fair dilution by:

- Making **performance-based Bounties** the default.
- Requiring clear **verification criteria** for each Bounty.
- Emphasizing that **no verified outcome = no points = no dilution**.

### 9.4 Guidance for Founders: How to Expand the Pool

When founders want to bring in more people (e.g. more growth partners, designers, etc.), the product should guide them to:

1. **Announce expansion clearly**
   - Example copy in UI:

     > "You're adding new Bounties and allowing new contributors to earn points. Existing contributors' percentage share may decrease, but the goal is for the overall pie (revenue/profit) to grow enough that everyone benefits."

2. **Tie new points strictly to performance**
   - Every new Bounty should:
     - Be linked to a measurable outcome (MRR, active clinics, activated accounts, etc.).
     - Have a **verification window** (e.g. 90-day retention).
     - Award points only on confirmation of that outcome.

3. **Avoid “fluffy” point grants**
   - Avoid awarding points for:
     - Ideas without implementation.
     - One-off artifacts (a slide deck, an email draft) without evidence of impact.

   - Where necessary, label such work as **fixed-fee** instead of point-based.

4. **Use examples to calibrate**
   - In the UI, provide templates such as:
     - “New clinic active 90 days → 100 points.”
     - “Case study that leads to a clinic within 120 days → 50 points.”
     - “Hit $10k net-new MRR this quarter → 500 point bonus.”

### 9.5 Contributor-Facing Fairness Messaging

Earn A Slice should include a concise, reused block of copy explaining fairness and dilution to contributors. For example:

> - You earn **points** when you deliver verified outcomes (like new customers, revenue, or key milestones).
> - Each payout period, a fixed % of the product’s revenue/profit is shared among contributors proportional to their points.
> - As new contributors join and earn points, your **percentage** of the pool may decrease, but our goal is that the **total pool grows** because of everyone’s work.
> - If new contributors don’t generate results, they don’t earn points—and can’t dilute you.
> - Rules for earning points are public and defined before you do the work.

This should be visible on:

- Project onboarding pages.
- The “How this pool works” modal.
- Contributor terms/FAQ.

### 9.6 Example Scenario (for UX copy / education)

**Before expansion:**

- Pool: 10% of net profit.
- Profit this quarter: $40,000 → Pool = $4,000.
- Total points: 4,000.
- Early contributor holds 1,000 points (25%) → receives **$1,000**.

**After expansion:**

- New contributors join and are awarded points only after landing net-new clinics and growth.
- Profit next quarter: $120,000 → Pool = $12,000.
- Total points: 6,000.
- Early contributor still has 1,000 points (now ~16.7% of pool) → receives **$2,000**.

**Message to users:**

> “Your percentage of the pool went down, but your payout doubled because the product grew. Pool expansion is designed to be positive-sum when new contributions create real revenue.”

### 9.7 Guardrails & Defaults

To keep everyone reward/revenue-focused, Earn A Slice should:

- Default new Bounties to **outcome-based templates** (e.g., revenue, active users, retained customers).
- Encourage **verification windows** (90–120 days for revenue-linked work).
- Make **manual point grants** (not tied to any Bounty) an explicit advanced action with warnings:
  - “This may dilute existing contributors without clear performance criteria.”

- Provide a short “Best Practices for Founders” guide when they first create a Reward Pool, emphasizing:
  - Pay for results, not hours.
  - Don’t grant points retroactively without explaining to current contributors.
  - Consider separate pools for distinct products/initiatives to avoid cross-dilution.

# 10. MVP vs. Later Phases

### MVP (what you build first)

**Core surfaces:**

- Project Page with 3 tabs: Readme, Bounties, Contributors
- Simple Discover page (browse public projects)
- Contributor Dashboard (my points, my earnings, my submissions)
- Founder Dashboard (review submissions, run payouts, manage bounties)

**Core mechanics:**

- Bounty creation with point rewards and tags
- Claim → Submit → Approve flow
- Points auto-computed per contributor
- Manual payout flow (founder enters profit, sees split, pays externally)
- Payout verification (contributors confirm receipt, builds trust)

**Scope constraints:**

- Single founder per project
- Manual revenue/profit entry
- Manual payouts (bank, PayPal, Wise, etc.)
- Public projects on Discover (no invite-only yet)

### What's OUT of MVP (explicitly deferred)

- ❌ Discussions/forums (use Discord/Slack)
- ❌ In-app chat (use Discord/Slack)
- ❌ Multi-founder admin roles
- ❌ Integrations (Stripe, Paddle, HubSpot)
- ❌ Automated verification of outcomes
- ❌ Point decay/expiry
- ❌ Contributor reputation/ranking system
- ❌ Built-in payouts (Stripe Connect)
- ❌ Private/invite-only projects
- ❌ Contributor profiles across projects

### Later Phases

**Phase 2: Trust & Scale**

- Multi-founder roles (admin, reviewer)
- Private/invite-only projects
- Contributor profiles with cross-project earnings
- Reputation scores based on approval rate

**Phase 3: Automation**

- Stripe/Paddle integration for revenue verification
- CRM integration for lead/customer verification
- Built-in payouts via Stripe Connect
- Automated payout scheduling

**Phase 4: Network Effects**

- Contributor matching/recommendations
- Project recommendations based on skills
- Public contributor leaderboards
- Investor/partner discovery layer

# 11. Positioning & Narrative

**Tagline options:**

- “Open-source your startup’s growth. Pay by results, share the upside.”
- “Build together, share the revenue.”
- “For founders who can ship product but need help shipping traction.”

**How to explain it in one paragraph:**

> Earn A Slice lets you run your startup like an open-source project for growth. You define a small slice of your revenue or profit as a Reward Pool, post Bounties (like "bring in a clinic" or "write a case study that converts"), and contributors who deliver real results earn points that translate into recurring payouts. No messy equity grants, no vague promises—just performance-based rewards that keep everyone aligned.

---

# 12. Risks, Legal & Trust

This section addresses known risks, legal considerations, platform sustainability, and trust mechanisms.

---

## 12.1 Legal & Tax Considerations

> ⚠️ This section provides guidance, not legal advice. Founders and contributors should consult their own legal/tax advisors.

### Structure: Commission/Bonus, Not Equity

Earn A Slice pools are structured as **contractual profit-sharing arrangements**—similar to sales commissions, affiliate payouts, or performance bonuses. This is explicitly **not equity**:

- No cap table entry
- No voting rights
- No ownership stake
- No securities issued

This structure is intentional: it avoids the complexity of securities law while still providing meaningful upside to contributors.

### Founder Obligations

Founders should be aware of:

| Area                          | Consideration                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tax reporting**             | In the US, founders may need to issue 1099s to contributors earning over $600/year. Other jurisdictions have similar requirements.                                        |
| **Contractor classification** | Contributors are independent contractors, not employees. Avoid patterns that could create employment relationships (e.g., set hours, exclusive work, direct supervision). |
| **International payments**    | Some countries have withholding requirements or are restricted for payments. Use payment providers (Wise, PayPal) that handle compliance.                                 |
| **Written agreements**        | Use clear Contributor Terms that define the arrangement, IP ownership, and payout rules.                                                                                  |

### Contributor Obligations

Contributors should understand:

- Payouts are **taxable income** in most jurisdictions
- They are responsible for their own tax reporting and payment
- They are operating as independent contractors, not employees
- No profit = no payout (this is not guaranteed income)

### Platform Stance

Earn A Slice provides:

- Template Contributor Terms that projects can adopt or customize
- Clear documentation of the profit-sharing model
- Transparency tools (payout history, verification) to create an audit trail

Earn A Slice does **not** provide legal advice or guarantee compliance with any jurisdiction's laws.

---

## 12.2 Platform Revenue Model

Earn A Slice sustains itself by participating in the same model it enables:

### Revenue Streams

1. **Platform share of profit pools**
   - Earn A Slice takes a percentage of each project's reward pool (e.g., 10% of the pool)
   - Example: Founder sets pool at 10% of profit. On a $3k/mo profit project, pool = $300. EAS takes $30, contributors share $270.
   - We get paid when contributors get paid—fully aligned incentives

2. **Platform fee (optional, later)**
   - Monthly subscription for premium features (private projects, advanced analytics, integrations)
   - Free tier always available for public projects with basic features

### Revenue Math (realistic scenarios)

Most indie projects earn $1-5k/mo, not $10k+. Here's what platform revenue looks like:

| Project profit/mo | 10% Pool | EAS @ 10% of pool | EAS annually |
| ----------------- | -------- | ----------------- | ------------ |
| $1,000            | $100     | $10               | $120         |
| $3,000            | $300     | $30               | $360         |
| $5,000            | $500     | $50               | $600         |
| $10,000           | $1,000   | $100              | $1,200       |

To reach $100k ARR from pool share alone at average $3k/mo projects: **~278 active projects**.

### Future Revenue Streams

Pool share alone requires significant scale. These additional revenue streams can accelerate sustainability:

1. **Code Marketplace ("Buy a Vibe, Ship a Biz")**
   - Founders/contributors can sell full app templates, starter kits, or "franchise packages"
   - Buyer gets a working codebase + optional ongoing support
   - Platform takes 15-20% of each sale
   - Example: AI transcription SaaS template sells for $500 × 50 buyers = $25k GMV → $5k to EAS

2. **Feature Marketplace**
   - Pre-built features (auth, billing, AI integrations, admin dashboards) sold as drop-in modules
   - Platform takes 15-20% of sales
   - Contributors can build these as bounties, then resell to other projects

3. **Bounty Templates / Playbooks**
   - Successful bounty completions packaged as repeatable playbooks
   - "Here's exactly how I got 10 clinics for Oath" sold to other founders
   - Platform takes 10-20%

4. **Premium Tier ($29-99/mo)**
   - Private/invite-only projects
   - Advanced analytics (contributor performance, payout forecasting)
   - Priority support
   - Integrations (Stripe, accounting software)

### Revenue Mix Target (Year 2+)

| Stream                | % of revenue | Notes                                  |
| --------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Pool share            | 40-50%       | Recurring, scales with project success |
| Marketplace sales     | 30-40%       | Higher margin, transactional           |
| Premium subscriptions | 10-20%       | Predictable, sticky                    |

### Alignment

**We only get paid when value is delivered.** Earn A Slice takes nothing at pool creation—our cut comes from actual payouts after:

1. A contributor claims and completes a bounty
2. The founder approves the submission
3. Points are awarded and a payout is run

No approved work = no contributor payout = no platform revenue. We succeed only when the matchmaking works.

This means Earn A Slice is incentivized to:

- Attract projects that actually pay out
- Build features that help contributors find and complete bounties
- Surface trustworthy projects and filter out bad actors

---

## 12.3 Claim Mechanics

Bounty claiming determines who can work on a task and how conflicts are resolved.

### Configurable Claim Mode

Founders can configure each bounty as:

| Mode                | How it works                                                                  | Best for                                                                     |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Single claim**    | One contributor claims → others locked out until they submit or claim expires | Tasks requiring coordination, exclusive relationships, sensitive work        |
| **Multiple claims** | Anyone can work on it → first approved submission wins                        | Competitive tasks, leads/referrals, content where multiple attempts are fine |

### Claim Expiry

To prevent contributors from blocking bounties indefinitely:

- Claims expire after a configurable period (default: 14-30 days) with no submission
- Founders can manually release a claim if a contributor goes dark
- Contributors receive a reminder before expiry

### Submission After Expiry

- If a claim expires, the bounty reopens for others
- The original contributor can still submit, but they're now competing with anyone else who claims it
- First approved submission wins the points

---

## 12.4 Profit Verification & Trust

In the MVP, profit reporting is **founder-reported** (honor-based). This is a known limitation.

### Why Honor-Based for MVP

- Automated verification requires deep integrations (Stripe, accounting software)
- Different businesses measure profit differently
- Building trust through transparency is faster than building integrations

### Transparency as the Primary Defense

The platform surfaces patterns that help contributors evaluate trustworthiness:

| Signal                  | What it shows                                                                 |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Payout history**      | Has this founder ever paid out? How much? How often?                          |
| **Verification rate**   | What % of payouts have been confirmed received by contributors?               |
| **Consistency**         | Are reported profits consistent over time, or suspiciously volatile?          |
| **Zero-profit streaks** | "Founder has reported $0 profit for 4 consecutive quarters" (visible warning) |
| **Contributor reviews** | (Later) Contributors can rate their experience                                |

### What's Surfaced Publicly

- Total $ paid out (verified by contributor confirmations)
- Number of verified payouts
- Number of active, earning contributors
- Any disputed payouts (red flag, prominently shown)

### Future: Automated Verification

Phase 3+ will add optional integrations:

- Stripe/Paddle for revenue verification
- Accounting software for profit verification
- This becomes a trust signal: "This project has verified revenue via Stripe"

---

## 12.5 Contributor Terms & IP

Every project should have clear Contributor Terms. Earn A Slice provides templates.

### What Terms Should Cover

| Topic                          | Guidance                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **IP ownership**               | Typically: contributor assigns IP for approved work to the project. Rejected work remains contributor's. |
| **Confidentiality**            | Contributors may see non-public info. Basic NDA terms should apply.                                      |
| **No employment relationship** | Explicit statement that this is a contractor/commission arrangement.                                     |
| **Payout rules**               | No profit = no payout. Points have no cash value until a payout occurs.                                  |
| **Dispute resolution**         | How disagreements are handled (usually: good faith discussion, then arbitration).                        |
| **Limitation of liability**    | Standard limitation clauses.                                                                             |

### Platform-Provided Templates

Earn A Slice will provide:

- A standard Contributor Agreement template (editable by founders)
- A simple IP assignment clause
- FAQ explaining what contributors are agreeing to

Founders can customize or use their own legal documents, but must have _something_ in place.

---

## 12.6 Project Lifecycle

What happens when projects change or end.

### Scenario: Startup Pivots

- If the product pivots significantly, the founder can:
  - Continue the existing pool (if the pivot is minor)
  - Close the current pool and start a new one for the new direction
- Existing points remain valid for any remaining payouts before closure
- Founder should communicate changes to contributors

### Scenario: Startup Dies

- If the startup shuts down, points become worthless (no profit = no payouts)
- This is expected and should be clear to contributors from the start
- No payout obligations remain after shutdown

### Scenario: Startup Is Sold / Acquired

- Reward pools **do not automatically transfer** to the acquiring company
- Founder should:
  - Run a final payout before or at closing
  - Clearly communicate that the pool is ending
  - Optionally: negotiate with acquirer to honor existing contributor relationships

### Pool Commitment & Duration

Pools have a **defined commitment period** set at creation. This protects contributors from surprise terminations.

**At pool creation, founder chooses:**

- Commitment length: 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, or 3 years (default: 1 year)
- This is the minimum period the pool will run
- Displayed prominently to contributors: "This pool runs through December 2027"

**During the commitment period:**

- Founder cannot unilaterally terminate the pool
- Pool continues as long as the product exists and has profit to distribute
- Early termination only allowed for qualifying events (see below)

**Qualifying early termination events:**

- Startup shuts down (no business = no pool)
- Startup is sold/acquired (see acquisition section above)
- Mutual agreement with contributors (rare, requires transparency)

**Extending the pool:**

- Founders can extend the pool at any time—no need to wait until the end
- Extension adds another commitment period (6mo/1yr/2yr/3yr) from current date
- Existing contributors and their points carry forward seamlessly
- Great for founders who are happy with their team and want to keep the momentum

**At commitment end (if not extended):**

- Founder can extend for another term, or
- Let the pool expire naturally with 90-day notice to contributors
- Final payout is run for any outstanding profit
- Points become inactive after final payout

**Contributor visibility:**

- Pool end date is displayed prominently on every bounty
- Before claiming, contributors see: _"This pool runs through June 2025 (3 months remaining)"_
- Contributors make an informed choice—if 3 months of payouts isn't worth the work, they can skip it
- If founder extends, everyone keeps earning

**Why this matters:**

Contributors need to trust that the upside they're working toward won't vanish arbitrarily. A defined commitment period makes the deal clear upfront and holds founders accountable.

### Modifying Pool Terms

- Founders can change pool terms (%, payout frequency) with notice
- Changes only affect **future periods**, never retroactive
- Contributors should be notified of any changes

---

## 12.7 Anti-Gaming & Known Risks

The MVP relies primarily on transparency and reputation to deter bad actors.

### Known Gaming Risks

| Risk                     | Description                                                     | Mitigation                                                                       |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Underreported profit** | Founder claims lower profit to reduce payouts                   | Transparency signals, pattern detection, later: verified revenue integrations    |
| **Fake contributors**    | Founder's friends get points for no real work                   | Public contributor list, payout history visible to all contributors              |
| **Fake submissions**     | Contributor claims credit for organic leads/work they didn't do | Founder approval is the check; require evidence in submissions                   |
| **Claim squatting**      | Contributor claims bounty but never delivers                    | Claim expiry, founder can release claims                                         |
| **Collusion**            | Founder + contributor split payouts unfairly                    | Other contributors can see the split; reputation matters for future contributors |

### MVP Defense: Transparency

The primary defense is making everything visible:

- All contributors can see the full contributor list and points
- All contributors can see payout history and confirmations
- Disputed payouts are flagged publicly
- Patterns (zero-profit streaks, unverified payouts) are surfaced

Bad actors damage their own reputation, making it harder to attract future contributors.

### Future Defenses

- Contributor ratings and reviews
- Cross-project reputation scores
- Verified revenue integrations
- Platform-level flagging of suspicious patterns
