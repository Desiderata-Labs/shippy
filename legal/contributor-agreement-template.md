# Project Contributor Agreement (Template)

Last updated: 2025-12-19

This Project Contributor Agreement (the "**Agreement**") is between:

- **Project Owner:** {project_owner_party_legal_name} ("**Project Owner**")
- **Contributor:** {contributor_legal_name_or_display_name} ("**Contributor**")

for the project:

- **Project:** {project_name}
- **Project URL:** {project_url}
- **Project Owner Representative (if applicable):** {project_owner_authorized_representative_name} ({project_owner_authorized_representative_title})

For clarity: the "Project Owner" above is the **legal counterparty** to this Agreement. If the Project Owner is an entity (for example, an LLC or corporation), you are contracting with that entity (not an individual founder), and any representative listed above is acting on behalf of the entity.

Shippy ({platform_name}, operated by {platform_operator_legal_name}) provides the platform used to present and record acceptance of this Agreement, but **Shippy is not a party** to this Agreement.

Project Owner offers and agrees to be bound by this Agreement by enabling it for the Project in Shippy and allowing Contributors to claim Bounties for the Project.

## Key terms (plain-language summary)

- **You only earn points when approved.** Points are earned only if a Submission is approved for a Bounty.
- **Work ownership.** If your Submission is approved, you assign the approved Work Product to the Project Owner (with a license for any Background IP you include).
- **No payout guarantees.** Payouts depend on project performance and reporting, and may be zero.
- **Payouts may require onboarding.** You may need to complete {payment_processor_name} onboarding before receiving payouts.
- **Reward Pool commitment end.** If the Project has a Reward Pool, the commitment runs through {reward_pool_commitment_ends_at} unless extended (with notice requirements described below).
- **Not employment.** You are an independent contractor; you handle your own taxes.

## 1. Definitions

- "**Bounty**" means a task/outcome posted for the Project on Shippy.
- "**Submission**" means the materials/evidence you submit in connection with a Bounty.
- "**Approved Submission**" means a Submission that Project Owner approves in Shippy.
- "**Work Product**" means the portion of your Submission that is approved and any related deliverables created specifically for the Bounty and included in the Approved Submission.
- "**Background IP**" means any pre-existing materials, tools, templates, know-how, or intellectual property you owned or developed outside of the Bounty.
- "**Points**" means the point rewards associated with Bounties on Shippy, as recorded by Shippy when Points are awarded (upon approval).
- "**Reward Pool**" means a reward pool configured for the Project on Shippy that allocates a portion of project profits/revenue to contributors. The Project may have one or more Reward Pools.
- "**Pool Capacity**" means the total points representing 100% of the Reward Pool at a given time.
- "**Reward Pool Commitment End**" means the end date/time of the Project’s current Reward Pool commitment as displayed in Shippy: {reward_pool_commitment_ends_at}.
- "**Payment Processor**" means the third-party payment provider used to facilitate payouts (for example, {payment_processor_name}).

## 2. Scope; approval; additional bounty terms

2.1 **Scope.** This Agreement governs your work on Bounties for the Project and your Submissions.

2.2 **Approval discretion and criteria.** Project Owner will evaluate Submissions against the Bounty’s stated acceptance criteria. Project Owner may approve or reject a Submission consistent with those criteria and any applicable policies shown in the Bounty.

2.3 **Bounty-specific additional terms.** A Bounty may include additional terms specific to that Bounty (for example, stricter confidentiality, access/security requirements, or data handling requirements) ("**Bounty Terms**"). If shown to you at claim time and accepted, the Bounty Terms are part of this Agreement for that Bounty.

## 3. Work Product and intellectual property

3.1 **Assignment (approved work).** Upon approval of a Submission, you irrevocably assign to Project Owner all right, title, and interest in and to the Work Product, including all intellectual property rights.

3.2 **Work made for hire.** To the extent any Work Product qualifies as a "work made for hire" under applicable law, Project Owner is the author and owner.

3.3 **Moral rights.** To the extent permitted by law, you waive any moral rights in the Work Product.

3.4 **Background IP license.** You retain ownership of Background IP. To the extent you incorporate Background IP into Work Product, you grant Project Owner a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable license (with the right to sublicense) to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, publicly perform, publicly display, and otherwise exploit that Background IP as part of (or in connection with) the Work Product.

3.5 **Third-party materials / open source.** You will not include third-party materials (including open source) in any Submission unless you have the right to do so and comply with applicable license terms, attribution, and notice requirements. You will provide Project Owner any required notices or license text upon request.

3.6 **Fallback license.** If any assignment above is not effective under applicable law, you grant Project Owner a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, sublicensable license to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, publicly perform, publicly display, and otherwise exploit the Work Product for any purpose.

3.7 **Further assurances.** You will execute reasonable documents and take reasonable actions requested to evidence or perfect the assignments/licenses above.

## 4. Points, payouts, and payment processor

4.1 **Earning points.** You earn Points only when Project Owner approves a Submission for a Bounty in Shippy. Rejected Submissions do not earn Points.

4.2 **How payouts work.** If the Project uses a Reward Pool, payout amounts (if any) are determined by the Project’s configuration on Shippy and Project Owner’s reported inputs.

4.2.1 **No retroactive changes.** Changes to Reward Pool settings (including pool percentage, payout frequency, and Pool Capacity) apply only to future payout periods and do not retroactively change payout amounts for payout periods already ended or already calculated/announced in Shippy.

4.3 **Pool capacity and dilution.** Your percentage share for a payout period is generally `Your Points / Pool Capacity`. Project Owner may expand Pool Capacity, which reduces the percentage share represented by existing Points and may affect future payouts.

4.4 **No guarantees.** You understand and agree:

- no minimum payout is guaranteed;
- payouts depend on project performance and may be zero;
- payout calculations may rely on Project Owner reporting and may be disputed between users; and
- Shippy does not guarantee payout timing or amounts.

  4.5 **Payment processor onboarding.** You may be required to complete Payment Processor onboarding (including identity and/or tax verification) before receiving payouts. Payment Processor terms apply to payment services, and payouts may be delayed, blocked, reversed, or otherwise affected by Payment Processor requirements or restrictions.

  4.6 **Not wages; not equity.** Points and payouts are not wages, salary, or employment compensation, and are not equity or securities. They do not grant you any ownership interest in the Project Owner or Shippy.

  4.7 **Reward Pool commitment period (not forever by default).** If the Project has a Reward Pool, the Reward Pool commitment runs through the Reward Pool Commitment End unless extended/renewed (or earlier ended due to a qualifying event such as shutdown/acquisition, or as otherwise permitted by applicable law).

If Project Owner does not extend/renew the Reward Pool, Project Owner will provide at least {pool_expiration_notice_days} days notice through Shippy before allowing the Reward Pool commitment to lapse.

Unless extended/renewed, after the Reward Pool Commitment End:

- Project Owner is not obligated to run payouts for payout periods after the Reward Pool Commitment End; and
- your earned Points remain on record but will not entitle you to payouts for payout periods after the Reward Pool Commitment End.

## 5. Independent contractor; taxes

5.1 **Independent contractor.** You are an independent contractor and not an employee, agent, partner, or joint venturer of Project Owner or Shippy. You control how and when you perform work, subject to Bounty requirements and deadlines.

5.2 **Taxes.** You are solely responsible for taxes and reporting obligations related to payouts you receive (including income taxes, self-employment taxes, and VAT/GST where applicable). Project Owner and/or the Payment Processor may collect tax information and issue tax forms as required by law.

## 6. Confidentiality

6.1 **Confidential Information.** "Confidential Information" means non-public information about the Project disclosed to you, including non-public documents, credentials/API keys, customer/prospect information, and non-public access to tools/dashboards.

6.2 **Obligations.** You will use Confidential Information only to perform Bounty work, not disclose it without permission, and protect it using reasonable security measures.

6.3 **Exceptions.** Confidential Information does not include information that becomes public through no fault of yours, was already known to you without restriction, is independently developed without using Confidential Information, or is lawfully obtained without restriction.

6.4 **Bounty Terms may be stricter.** Some Bounties may include stricter confidentiality or data handling requirements in Bounty Terms.

## 7. Portfolio and attribution

7.1 **Portfolio.** Unless restricted by Bounty Terms or written instructions from Project Owner, you may reference your participation and display non-confidential Work Product in a portfolio once it is made public by the Project (or with Project Owner permission).

7.2 **Attribution.** Project Owner may publicly attribute approved Work Product to your Shippy username, consistent with Shippy’s transparency features, unless you opt out where supported.

## 8. Representations and warranties

8.1 **Representations and warranties.** Contributor represents and warrants that:

8.1.1 Contributor has the legal capacity and authority to enter into this Agreement.

8.1.2 Contributor’s Work Product is original to Contributor (except for properly licensed third-party materials) and does not infringe third-party rights.

8.1.3 Contributor has the authority to assign and license rights as described in this Agreement.

8.1.4 Contributor is not violating any obligations to an employer or third party that would conflict with this Agreement or the work Contributor performs.

8.2 **Indemnification (IP).** Contributor will indemnify and hold harmless Project Owner from any third-party claim alleging that the Work Product (as delivered by Contributor) infringes or misappropriates that third party’s intellectual property rights.
This indemnity does not apply to the extent the claim arises from materials, instructions, or requirements provided by Project Owner, or modifications made by Project Owner after delivery.

## 9. Limitation of liability (between Project Owner and Contributor)

To the maximum extent permitted by law, neither party will be liable to the other for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of this Agreement.

To the maximum extent permitted by law, Project Owner’s total liability to Contributor for any claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement will not exceed the greater of (a) $100 and (b) the total payouts actually paid to Contributor for the Project in the 12 months before the event giving rise to the claim. This cap does not apply to liability that cannot be limited under applicable law or to claims arising from fraud or willful misconduct.

## 10. Disputes; governing law

10.1 **User-to-user disputes.** Disputes about approvals, points, profit reporting, or payouts are disputes between Project Owner and Contributor. Shippy is not responsible for resolving or paying user-to-user disputes.

10.2 **Governing law and forum.** This Agreement is governed by the laws of {governing_law}. Any dispute arising out of this Agreement will be brought in {forum_selection}, unless the parties agree to arbitration in writing.

## 11. Notices

Notices must be sent to:

- Project Owner: {project_owner_contact_email}
- Contributor: {contributor_contact_email}

## 12. Entire agreement; amendments; severability

12.1 **Entire agreement.** This Agreement (including any accepted Bounty Terms) is the entire agreement between the parties regarding Bounty work for the Project.

12.2 **Amendments.** Project Owner may update this Agreement with notice. Amendments do not revoke Points already earned for Approved Submissions. If Shippy requires re-acceptance (for example, version changes), you must accept updated terms before making additional claims.

12.3 **Severability.** If any part of this Agreement is unenforceable, the rest remains in effect.

## 13. Term and termination

13.1 **Term.** This Agreement remains in effect while Contributor participates in the Project (including while Contributor holds Points for the Project).

13.2 **Termination of active participation.** Either party may end Contributor’s active participation at any time, meaning Contributor may no longer claim new Bounties for the Project.

13.3 **Points are non-forfeitable.** Points earned for Approved Submissions are non-forfeitable and cannot be revoked or forfeited due to termination of active participation. Contributor remains eligible to receive payouts attributable to earned Points for payout periods during the Reward Pool commitment (and any extensions/renewals), if and when payouts are made for the Project, subject to Payment Processor requirements and applicable law.

13.4 **Other survival.** Upon termination, (a) any assignment/licenses granted for approved Work Product remain in effect, and (b) Confidentiality obligations for Confidential Information already received remain in effect.
