# Shippy

> Build together. Share the upside.

Shippy is a platform where founders "open-source" parts of their startup by posting real work (growth, marketing, sales, etc.), and contributors who help ship it earn an ongoing share of the upside—not just a one-off payment.

Post work you need help with. Contributors who deliver earn recurring royalties, not just one-off payments.

## How It Works

No vesting schedules. Just ship work and get paid.

### 01. Post Bounties

Create specific tasks with point rewards. Each point = 0.1% of your profit share. Only pay for work that gets done.

**Example bounties:**

- SEO blog post: 50 points
- Product video: 100 points
- Landing page copy: 30 points

### 02. Ship Work

Contributors claim bounties, deliver proof of work, and earn points when approved.

**Example workflow:**

- SEO blog post by Sarah M. → +50 pts (approved)
- Product video → in review

### 03. Split Profits

When you profit, contributors get paid based on their points. Founders only pay out what was actually earned.

**Example payout:**

- March payout: $2,400
- Split: 45% (Sarah M.), 30% (Alex K.), 25% (Jordan L.)

### 04. Verify & Repeat

Contributors confirm receipt. Transparent history builds trust for future work.

**Example verifications:**

- Sarah M. confirmed: $1,080
- Alex K. confirmed: $720

## Key Concepts

### The GitHub Mental Model

| GitHub       | Shippy           | Notes                                         |
| ------------ | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Repository   | **Project**      | The product/company being built               |
| README.md    | **Readme**       | About, mission, links (Discord, assets, docs) |
| Issues       | **Bounties**     | Specific tasks with point rewards             |
| Contributors | **Contributors** | Auto-computed from accepted submissions       |
| Pull Request | **Submission**   | Contributor's work + proof                    |
| Merge        | **Approval**     | Founder approves → points awarded             |
| Sponsors     | **Reward Pool**  | The $ that flows to contributors              |

### The Core Loop

```
Bounty → Claim → Submit → Approve → Points → Payout → Verify
```

Every feature supports or enhances this loop.

### Trust Through Transparency

The platform's primary defense against gaming is transparency:

- Public contributor lists and point allocations
- Visible payout history with contributor confirmations
- Surfaced trust signals (verified payouts, zero-profit warnings)
